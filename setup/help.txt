WELCOME to F(?) Virtual Window Manager (FVWM).

If you are new to FVWM and wondering what it is all about. The first thing to bear in mind it is not a Desktop Environment (GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc). A desktop environment comes with a collection of preconfigured settings and software (file managers, docks/panels, and so on) all integrated together. 

FVWM is a Window Manager (WM). What sets it apart from other WMs, it is also a *Virtual* window manager. Among the powerful Fvwm features is the virtual desktop, which allows you to place windows on an area much larger than the actual size of the visible display.

FVWM3 (ver. 1.0.4-123)

It comes with a minimal startup configure. It gives the user the choice of expression. Details such as the appearance of windows, function of panels, pagers, programs that will be used, mouse/key control, etc., are created and defined by the user.

Xfce-Fvwm Extensions (ver. 1.0.1)

Is a collection of ready-made configs. A model for you to use, modify or create your own extensions. The default FVWM config is the base, directly in ~/.fvwm. The config is split into folders and runs in the same sequence as the original. The additional extension configs are simply added in associated folders.

Previous myExt configs are not compatible with 3.x. This new version is user-oriented, to add and make changes in the preset configs and to create own without getting overwritten by new updates. It includes three new folders and system files:

coreEXT  + coreEXT.sys	- essential myExt configs.
extraEXT + extraEXT.sys - additional configs.
userEXT  + userEXT.sys  - reads user configs, does changes to core and extra config settings.
