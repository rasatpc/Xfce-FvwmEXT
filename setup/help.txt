WELCOME to XFCE and FVWM (F? Virtual Window Manager).

Xfce is a lightweight desktop environment for UNIX-like operating systems. It aims to be fast and low on system resources, while still being visually appealing and user friendly.

FVWM is a Window Manager (WM). What sets it apart from other WMs, it is also a *Virtual* window manager. Among the powerful Fvwm features is the virtual desktop, which allows you to place windows on an area much larger than the actual size of the visible display.

FVWM3 (ver. 1.0.4-123)

It comes with a minimal startup configure. It gives the user the choice of expression. Details such as the appearance of windows, function of panels, pagers, programs that will be used, mouse/key control, etc., are created and defined by the user.

Xfce-Fvwm Extensions (ver. 1.0.7)

Is a collection of ready-made configs. A model for you to use, modify or create your own extensions. The default FVWM config is the base, directly in ~/.fvwm. The config is split into folders and runs in the same sequence as the original. The additional extension configs are simply added in associated folders.

coreEXT  + coreEXT.sys	- essential myExt configs.
extraEXT + extraEXT.sys - additional configs.
userEXT  + userEXT.sys  - reads user configs, does changes to core and extra config settings.
